# Static Painting & Decorating Company Website

## 💡 Background
This is a website I made for the web development module during my level 3 studies at college. It is based on a real painting and decorating company, but the 
content is made up.

## ⚙️ Structure
This is a simple static website where the main focus was to represent the business value and services. It was built mainly with HTML, CSS and Boostrap with a splash
of JavaScript which was used to create a simple paint and wallpaper calculator so that visitors could estimate how much of they would need for their home.

## 🔧 Tools
 - Bootstrap
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Tiny bit of JavaScript
